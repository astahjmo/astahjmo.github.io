Hello, I'm astah (or astaroth).

I chose this nickname to remember my beautiful history with the game Grand Chase.

Currently, I am learning C at 42sp school, and during my spare time, I'm delving into Elixir and Python for real-world application development at udel.

I'm an aspiring enthusiast in the world of mathematics and its intricacies, a realm where I find myself in a love-hate relationship. I also have a keen interest in physics and chemistry, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge during my free moments.

In the realm of computer science, I hold genuine interests in computer graphics, low-level programming, compiler design, and architecture design, among other areas.

I'm also starting to write blog posts, and you can check them out on my blog.

You can find me on Discord as astaroth#0373 or 'astah.'
